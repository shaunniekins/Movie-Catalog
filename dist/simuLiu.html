            <p><strong>Early Years</strong></p>
            <p>
                Simu Liu was born in Harbin, China, and moved to Canada when he was five years old. He is an only kid who was reared in Erin Mills, Mississauga, Ontario. For high school, he went to the University of Toronto Schools. Liu earned an Honours Business Administration (HBA) degree from the University of Western Ontario’s Ivey Business School in 2011. He was employed at Deloitte as an accountant but was subsequently laid off. Before opting to pursue a career as an actor and stuntman, he chose to look into other alternatives. He has a background in gymnastics as well as martial arts like Taekwondo and Wing Chun.
                His acting career began when he was cast as an extra in Guillermo del Toro’s Pacific Rim. Nikita (2012) and Beauty and the Beast are two of his early film credits (2014). He was a part of the Heroes Reborn stunt crew in 2015, acting as a stunt double in three episodes. He then went on to star as a series regular in the OMNI Television murder thriller Blood and Water (2015–2016), for which he was nominated for ACTRA and Canadian Screen Awards in 2017.
