            <p><strong>Early Years</strong></p>
            <p>
                Thomas Stanley Holland was born on June 1, 1996, in Kingston-upon-Thames, England. The oldest of four boys, he was born into an artistic family: Mom Nicola is a photographer, and dad Dominic is a stand-up comedian and an author.

                Holland began attending hip-hop dance classes at the Nifty Feet Dance Studio, whose owner, Lynne Page, helped choreograph the hit movie Billy Elliot (2000). After Holland's class performed at the 2006 Richmond Dance Festival, Page was convinced to send her pupil to audition for Billy Elliot the Musical.

                With no formal training in ballet or drama, Holland failed to impress most of the talent evaluators at the audition. However, he did impress Billy Elliot director Stephen Daldry, who loved Holland's natural performing ability and stage presence.

                Following two years of ballet lessons, Holland debuted with the West End production in June 2008 as Billy's best friend, Michael. He soon slid into the starring role, and wowed audiences with his acrobatic ability until his final performance in May 2010.
