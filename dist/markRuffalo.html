            <p><strong>Early Years</strong></p>
            <p>
                Born on November 22, 1967, in Kenosha, Wisconsin, Ruffalo spent his teenage years in Virginia Beach, Virginia, before moving with his family to San Diego after high school. He eventually settled in Los Angeles, studying acting at the Stella Adler Conservatory and subsequently co-founding the Orpheus Theatre Company. The theater was a platform for Ruffalo’s own acting and he landed small parts on TV and in films as well, but it was a meeting with playwright Kenneth Lonergan that changed his fate.

                Ruffalo began appearing in Lonergan's plays, notably This Is Our Youth, which led to his landing the male lead in Lonergan's soon-to-follow film You Can Count on Me (2000). Ruffalo’s performance drew critical and popular attention, and he took his first steps onto the Hollywood map. Notable roles came one after the next, and Ruffalo had prominent parts in such films as XX/XY (2002), Windtalkers (2002) and In the Cut (2003).
