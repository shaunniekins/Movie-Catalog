            <p><strong>Early Years</strong></p>
            <p>
                Brie Larson was born Brianne Sidonie Desaulniers, on October 1, 1989, in Sacramento, California. Her parents, Heather and Sylvain Desaulniers, were homeopathic chiropractors and worked together. She has a younger sister, Milaine. Her father was of French–Canadian origin. Larson did not receive formal school education and was schooled at home. Her first language was French.
                At the age of 6, Larson expressed the desire to become an actor. Her parents took her to the ‘American Conservatory Theater,’ where she auditioned for attending the training program. Larson was the youngest student to be selected for the program.
                When Larson was 7 years old, her parents divorced. This caused her to suffer an emotional crisis. Her mother moved to Los Angeles with her two daughters. There, Larson pursued her dreams of becoming an actor. The family lived in a single-room apartment and survived on meager resources.
